## Restricted IAM policy

**Released Aug 22, 2023**

The Console now supports customizing the IAM policy used while connecting to your AWS account. This is useful for cases where you are trying to connect your production accounts and you want to restrict the resources it has access to.

[Learn more about how to customize the IAM permissions](../console.md#iam-permissions).
