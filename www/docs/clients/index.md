Import from `sst/node` in your Lambda functions.

</HeadlineText>

Use the typesafe Node.js client in your functions to connect to your infrastructure.

---

## About

The SST Node.js client gives your Lambda functions typesafe access to the infrastructure in your app.

So for example, you can create an S3 bucket and [bind](../resource-binding.md) it to your API.

```ts title="stacks/MyStack.ts"
const bucket = new Bucket(stack, "myFiles");

api.bind([bucket]);
```

And in your Lambda function you can access that bucket through the SST Node client.

```ts {1,5} title="packages/functions/lambda.ts"
import { Bucket } from "sst/node/bucket";

await s3.send(
  new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: Bucket.myFiles.bucketName,
    Key: "greeting.txt",
    Body: "Hello world!",
  })
);
```

The Node client also gives you [handlers](#handlers) that wrap around your Lambda function with proper typesafety.

---

## Installation

The SST Node client is available through the [`sst`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sst) npm package.

<MultiPackagerCode>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install sst --save-exact
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add sst --exact
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add sst --save-exact
```

</TabItem>
</MultiPackagerCode>

If you are using our starters, the `sst` package should already be installed.

---

## Usage

You can then import a specific module from the client through `sst/node/*`.

```ts
import { Bucket } from "sst/node/bucket";
```

---

## Exports

The `sst/node` package is made up of a collection of modules. Like the `sst/node/api`, `sst/node/bucket`, etc. These modules have the following types of exports.

---

### Properties

The properties in each module helps you access the resources that are bound to the function.

For exmaple, you can access the bucket name in your function by importing `Bucket` from the `sst/node/bucket` module:

```ts
import { Bucket } from "sst/node/bucket";

console.log(Bucket.myFiles.bucketName);
```

:::info
Due to the use of top-level await, your functions need to be bundled in the `esm` format. If you created your app using [`create-sst`](packages/create-sst.md), the bundle format is likely already set to `esm`. [Here's how to set the Function bundle format](constructs/Function.md#format).
:::

---

### Handlers

The handlers in each module is a function that can wrap around Lambda function handlers. Here's an example of the [API handler](api.md#apihandler).

```js
import { ApiHandler } from "sst/node/api";

export const handler = ApiHandler((event) => {
  // ...
});
```

:::caution
Handlers are being actively worked on and are subject to change.
:::

Each handler has a specific purpose but they share a couple of things in common:

1. Provide proper typesafety.
2. They also initialize SST's context system to power our [`Hooks`](#hooks).

---

### Hooks

The hooks in each module are functions that you can call anywhere in your application code. It has access to things that are specific to the current invocation. This avoids having to pass things through multiple function calls down to our domain code.

:::caution
Hooks are being actively worked on and are subject to change.
:::

For example, you can call the [`useSession`](auth.md#usesession) hook to get access to the current user session in APIs that need authentication.

```ts
import { useSession } from "sst/node/auth";

const session = useSession();

if (session.type === "user") {
  console.log(session.properties.userID);
}
```

Behind the scenes, Hooks are powered by a SST's context system. Handlers like the [`GraphQLHandler`](graphql.md#graphqlhandler) and the [`AuthHandler`](auth.md#authhandler) create a global variable that keeps track of the _"context"_ for the current request. This context object gets reset on every invocation.

Hooks are an alternative to middleware solutions like [Middy](https://middy.js.org). They provide better typesafety and will be familiar to developers that've used Hooks in frontend frameworks.

---

### Others

Some of the modules also export types that can be used to define payloads for function calls. For example, the [`job`](job.md) exports [`JobTypes`](job.md#jobtypes).

The [`job`](job.md) also exports a [method](job.md#run) to run a job.

---

## Language support

Currently the client only supports JavaScript and TypeScript. If you are looking to add support for other languages, here's a basic guide to set the ball rolling. If you need help, feel free to <a href={ config.discord }>message us in Discord</a>.

#### How the client works

For every bound resource, an environment variable is added to the `Function`. The environment variable naming convention is:
```
SST_{construct}_{prop}_{id}
```

For example, if you bind a `Bucket`:

```ts
const myBucket = new Bucket(stack, "myBucket");
myFn.bind([myBucket]);
```

An environment variable called `SST_Bucket_bucketName_myBucket` is added, containing the bucket name as its value. The client should provide a convenient accessor to this value. In the Node client, the accessor pattern is:

```ts
import { Bucket } from "sst/node/bucket";
console.log(Bucket.myBucket.bucketName);
```

#### Fetching from SSM

Sometimes the value in the environment variable might be
```
__FETCH_FROM_SSM__
```
In this case, you'll need to fetch the value from SSM Parameter Store at path:
```
/sst/{app}/{stage}/{construct}/{id}/{prop}
```
The `{app}` and `{stage}` segments can be obtained from the environment variables `SST_APP` and `SST_STAGE`. You should batch SSM calls for efficiency.

#### Referencing SSM values

If the environment variable value is
```
__FETCH_FROM_SECRET__:{secret}
```
You must first resolve the Secret's value and assign it to the variable.

---

## Usage in tests

To access the [properties](#properties) in your tests, you'll need to wrap your tests with the [`sst bind`](../packages/sst.md#sst-bind) command.

```bash
sst bind "vitest run"
```

This allows the `sst/node` package to work as if it was running inside a Lambda function.
