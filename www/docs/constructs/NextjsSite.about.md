The `NextjsSite` construct is a higher level CDK construct that lets you create Next.js apps on AWS. It uses [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org) to build your Next.js app, and transforms the build output to a format that can be deployed to AWS.

Here's how it works at a high level.

- The client assets are deployed to an S3 Bucket, and served out from a CloudFront CDN for fast content delivery.
- The app server and API functions are deployed to Lambda. You can deploy to Lambda@Edge instead if the `edge` flag is enabled. Read more about [Single region vs Edge](#single-region-vs-edge).
- You can [reference other AWS resources](#using-aws-services) directly in your Next.js app.
- You can [configure custom domains](#custom-domains).

---

## Quick Start

1. You can use SST in an existing Next.js app in _drop-in mode_ or inside a monorepo app in _standalone mode_.

   - If you have an existing Next.js app, just run `npx create-sst` at the root and it'll configure SST in [_drop-in mode_](../what-is-sst.md#drop-in-mode).

     ```bash
     npx create-sst@latest
     ```

   - If you are starting from scratch, we recommend using our monorepo starter in [_standalone mode_](../what-is-sst.md#standalone-mode).

     ```bash
     npx create-sst@latest --template standard/nextjs
     ```

2. This adds the `NextjsSite` construct to your stacks code.

   ```ts {8-10}
   import { NextjsSite, StackContext } as sst from "sst/constructs";

   export default function MyStack({ stack }: StackContext) {

     // ... existing constructs

     // Create the Next.js site
     const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
       path: "packages/web",
     });

     // Add the site's URL to stack output
     stack.addOutputs({
       URL: site.url,
     });
   }
   ```

   When you are building your SST app, `NextjsSite` will invoke `npx open-next@latest build` inside the Next.js app directory. We also print out the `site.url` once deployed.

3. We also use the [`sst bind`](../packages/sst.md#sst-bind) command in your Next.js app's `package.json` to run `next dev`. This allows you to [bind your AWS resources](#using-aws-services) directly to your Next.js app.

   ```diff {3}
     "scripts": {
   -   "dev": "next dev",
   +   "dev": "sst bind next dev",
       "build": "next build",
     },
   ```

:::note
If you are using `getStaticProps` in your app, you'll need to change your build command from `next build` to `sst bind next build`. [Read more about this below](#resource-binding-and-ssg).
:::

Check out the [full Next.js tutorial](../start/nextjs.md).

---

## Working locally

To work on your Next.js app locally with SST:

1. Start SST in your project root.

   ```bash
   npx sst dev
   ```

2. Then start your Next.js app. This should run `sst bind next dev`.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

:::note
When running `sst dev`, SST does not deploy your Next.js app. It's meant to be run locally.
:::

---

## Single region vs edge

There are two ways you can deploy a Next.js app to your AWS account.

- Single region

  By default, the Next.js app server is deployed to a single region defined in your [`sst.config.ts`](../configuring-sst.md#config-function) or passed in via the [`--region`](packages/sst.md#global-options) flag.

- Edge

  Alternatively, you can choose to deploy to the edge. When deployed to the edge, middleware, SSR functions, and API routes are running on edge location that is physically closer to the end user. In this case, the app server is deployed to AWS Lambda@Edge.

  ```ts {3}
  const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
    path: "my-next-app/",
    edge: true,
  });
  ```

Note that, if you have a centralized database, Edge locations are often far away from your database. If you are querying your database in your SSR functions and API routes, you might experience much longer latency when deployed to the edge.

:::info
If you are not sure which one to use, we recommend deploying to a single region.
:::

---

## Custom domains

You can configure the app with a custom domain hosted either on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [externally](#configuring-externally-hosted-domain).

```js {3}
const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: "my-app.com",
});
```

Note that visitors to `http://` will be redirected to `https://`.

You can also configure an alias domain to point to the main domain. For example, to setup `www.my-app.com` to redirect to `my-app.com`:

```js {5}
const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    domainAlias: "www.my-app.com",
  },
});
```

---

## Using AWS services

SST makes it very easy for your `NextjsSite` construct to access other resources in your AWS account. Imagine you have an S3 bucket created using the [`Bucket`](../constructs/Bucket.md) construct. You can bind it to your Next.js app.

```ts {5}
const bucket = new Bucket(stack, "Uploads");

const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "packages/web",
  bind: [bucket],
});
```

This will attach the necessary IAM permissions and allow your Next.js app to access the bucket through the typesafe [`sst/node`](../clients/index.md) client.

```ts {4}
import { Bucket } from "sst/node/bucket";

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  console.log(Bucket.Uploads.bucketName);
}
```

You can read more about this over on the [Resource Binding](../resource-binding.md) doc.

---

#### Resource binding and SSG

If your app is using `getStaticProps` and is connecting to resources that've been bound it, you might see an error like this while deploying your app.

```
Cannot access bound resources. This usually happens if the "sst/node" package is used at build time.
```

You'll need to wrap your `next build` command with `sst bind next build`. This'll allow Next.js to build while having access to your resources.

---

#### Client side environment variables

You can also pass in environment variables directly to your client side code.

```ts {5-7}
const bucket = new Bucket(stack, "Bucket");

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "packages/web",
  environment: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME: bucket.bucketName,
  },
});
```

Now you can access the bucket's name in your client side code.

```ts
console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME);
```

In Next.js, only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are available in your client side code. Read more about using environment variables over on the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser).

You can also [read about how this works](../resource-binding.md#client-side-environment-variables) behind the scenes in SST.

---

## Warming

Server functions may experience performance issues due to Lambda cold starts. SST helps mitigate this by creating an EventBridge scheduled rule to periodically invoke the server function.

```ts {5}
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "packages/web",
  warm: 20,
});
```

Setting `warm` to 20 keeps 20 server function instances active, invoking them every 5 minutes.

Note that warming is currently supported only in regional mode.

#### Cost

There are three components to the cost:

1. EventBridge scheduler: $0.00864

   ```
   Requests cost — 8,640 invocations per month x $1/million = $0.00864
   ```

1. Warmer function: $0.145728288

   ```
   Requests cost — 8,640 invocations per month x $0.2/million = $0.001728
   Duration cost — 8,640 invocations per month x 1GB memory x 1s duration x $0.0000166667/GB-second = $0.144000288
   ```

1. Server function: $0.0161280288 per warmed instance

   ```
   Requests cost — 8,640 invocations per month x $0.2/million = $0.001728
   Duration cost — 8,640 invocations per month x 1GB memory x 100ms duration x $0.0000166667/GB-second = $0.0144000288
   ```

For example, keeping 50 instances of the server function warm will cost approximately **$0.96 per month**

```
$0.00864 + $0.145728288 + $0.0161280288 x 50 = $0.960769728
```

This cost estimate is based on the `us-east-1` region pricing and does not consider any free tier benefits.

---

## Logging

By default, Lambda sends all logs to the same AWS CloudWatch log group. This makes it hard to find the request you are looking for.

Starting v2.36.0, logs for individual routes are sent to separate log groups. The log group names are prefixed with `/sst/lambda`, followed by the app server function name, a hash of the route, and ends with route path in a readable format.

```
/sst/lambda/prod-app-MyNextSite-serverFunction6DFA6F1B-TiNQRV8IhGAu/979bddc4/about
```

With per-route logging, the [SST Console](../console.md) will display all routes within the resources page. To access logs for a specific route, simply select the route from the list.

![Next.js per-route logging](/img/nextjssite/per-route-logging.png)

You can opt-out of this by logging all routes to a single log group by setting the `logging` prop to `combined`.

```diff
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
+ logging: "combined",
});
```

---

## Source maps

Next.js uses Webpack to bundle your code, so the stack trace line numbers might not match. Turning on sourcemaps when building your Next.js app can fix this.

To enable sourcemaps, make sure you are not disabling [`per-route` logging](#logging). Then update your Next.js config:

```diff title="next.config.js"
const nextConfig = {
+ webpack: (config) => {
+   if (!options.dev) {
+     config.devtool = "source-map";
+   }
+   return config;
+ },
};
```

Now when your Next.js app builds, it'll generate the sourcemap files alongside your code. SST uploads these files to the [bootstrap bucket](../advanced/bootstrapping.md).

![Next.js sourcemap files](/img/nextjssite/sourcemap-files.png)

:::info
The sourcemap files are not added to the server bundle, keeping the function size small.
:::

With sourcemaps active, the [SST Console](../console.md) will display the errors with the right context.

## Examples

### Configuring custom domains

You can configure the website with a custom domain hosted either on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [externally](#configuring-externally-hosted-domain).

#### Using the basic config (Route 53 domains)

```js {3}
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: "my-app.com",
});
```

#### Redirect www to non-www (Route 53 domains)

```js {3-6}
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    domainAlias: "www.my-app.com",
  },
});
```

#### Configuring domains across stages (Route 53 domains)

```js {3-7}
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName:
      stack.stage === "prod" ? "my-app.com" : `${stack.stage}.my-app.com`,
    domainAlias: stack.stage === "prod" ? "www.my-app.com" : undefined,
  },
});
```

#### Configuring alternate domain names (Route 53 domains)

You can specify additional domain names for the site url. Note that the certificate for these names will not be automatically generated, so the certificate option must be specified. Also note that you need to manually create the Route 53 records for the alternate domain names.

```js
import { DnsValidatedCertificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";
import { HostedZone, RecordTarget, ARecord, AaaaRecord } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";
import { CloudFrontTarget } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53-targets";

// Look up hosted zone
const hostedZone = HostedZone.fromLookup(stack, "HostedZone", {
  domainName: "my-app.com",
});

// Create a certificate with alternate domain names
const certificate = new DnsValidatedCertificate(stack, "Certificate", {
  domainName: "foo.my-app.com",
  hostedZone,
  region: "us-east-1",
  subjectAlternativeNames: ["bar.my-app.com"],
});

// Create site
const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "foo.my-app.com",
    alternateNames: ["bar.my-app.com"],
    cdk: {
      hostedZone,
      certificate,
    },
  },
});

// Create A and AAAA records for the alternate domain names
const recordProps = {
  recordName: "bar.my-app.com",
  zone: hostedZone,
  target: RecordTarget.fromAlias(
    new CloudFrontTarget(site.cdk.distribution)
  ),
};
new ARecord(stack, "AlternateARecord", recordProps);
new AaaaRecord(stack, "AlternateAAAARecord", recordProps);
```

#### Importing an existing certificate (Route 53 domains)

```js {8}
import { Certificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    cdk: {
      certificate: Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, "MyCert", certArn),
    },
  },
});
```

Note that, the certificate needs be created in the `us-east-1`(N. Virginia) region as required by AWS CloudFront.

#### Specifying a hosted zone (Route 53 domains)

If you have multiple hosted zones for a given domain, you can choose the one you want to use to configure the domain.

```js {8-11}
import { HostedZone } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    cdk: {
      hostedZone: HostedZone.fromHostedZoneAttributes(stack, "MyZone", {
        hostedZoneId,
        zoneName,
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Configuring externally hosted domain

```js {5-11}
import { Certificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  customDomain: {
    isExternalDomain: true,
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    cdk: {
      certificate: Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, "MyCert", certArn),
    },
  },
});
```

Note that the certificate needs be created in the `us-east-1`(N. Virginia) region as required by AWS CloudFront, and validated. After the `Distribution` has been created, create a CNAME DNS record for your domain name with the `Distribution's` URL as the value. Here are more details on [configuring SSL Certificate on externally hosted domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html).

Also note that you can also migrate externally hosted domains to Route 53 by [following this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html).

### Configuring server function

```js {3-4}
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  timeout: "5 seconds",
  memorySize: "2048 MB",
});
```

### Configuring image optimization function

```js {3-5}
new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  imageOptimization: {
    memorySize: "2048 MB",
  },
});
```

### Advanced examples

#### Configuring VPC

Note that VPC is only supported when deploying to a [single region](#single-region-vs-edge).

```js
import { Vpc, SubnetType } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2";

// Create a VPC
const vpc = new Vpc(stack, "myVPC");

// Alternatively use an existing VPC
const vpc = Vpc.fromLookup(stack, "myVPC", { ... });
const vpcSubnets = {
  subnetType: SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS,
};

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    server: {
      vpc,
      vpcSubnets,
    },
    revalidation: {
      vpc,
      vpcSubnets,
    }
  }
});
```

#### Configuring log retention

```js
import { RetentionDays } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    server: {
      logRetention: RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH,
    }
  },
});
```

#### Using an existing S3 Bucket

```js
import { Bucket } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";
import { OriginAccessIdentity } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    bucket: Bucket.fromBucketName(stack, "Bucket", "my-bucket"),
    // Required for non-public buckets
    s3Origin: {
      originAccessIdentity: OriginAccessIdentity.fromOriginAccessIdentityId(
        stack,
        "OriginAccessIdentity",
        "XXXXXXXX"
      ),
    },    
  },
});
```

Setting the `originAccessIdentity` prop enables an imported bucket to be properly secured with a bucket policy without giving public access to the bucket.

#### Reusing CloudFront cache policies

CloudFront has a limit of 20 cache policies per AWS account. This is a hard limit, and cannot be increased. If you plan to deploy multiple Next.js sites, you can have the constructs share the same cache policies by reusing them across sites.

```js
import { Duration } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import {
  CachePolicy,
  CacheQueryStringBehavior,
  CacheHeaderBehavior,
  CacheCookieBehavior,
} from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

const serverCachePolicy = new CachePolicy(stack, "ServerCache", NextjsSite.buildDefaultServerCachePolicyProps());

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site1", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    serverCachePolicy,
  },
});

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site2", {
  path: "another-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    serverCachePolicy,
  },
});
```

#### Configuring CloudFront response headers policies

```js
import { ResponseHeadersPolicy } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    responseHeadersPolicy: ResponseHeadersPolicy.CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS,
  },
});
```

#### Enabling HTTP/3 support

```js
import { HttpVersion } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

new NextjsSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-next-app/",
  cdk: {
    distribution: {
      httpVersion: HttpVersion.HTTP3,
    },
  },
});
```

## Common Issues

### Next.js app built twice

When running `sst build` or `sst deploy`, you might notice the Next.js app building twice. This often occurs if you've configured custom domains or VPC within your `NextjsSite` construct or elsewhere in your app.

SST (AWS CDK) may need to look up specific details from the AWS account where the app is deployed. For instance, SST looks up the Route 53 hosted zone data for a custom domain; and fetches AWS region details when referencing an existing VPC. SST stores these details in `cdk.context.json`.

If `cdk.context.json` file is absent, SST builds the app, generates the `cdk.context.json` file, and then builds again.

To avoid building the Next.js app twice, ensure the `cdk.context.json` file is committed to your git repository.

Likewise, if the app builds twice in your CI environment, commit any modifications to `cdk.context.json`.
