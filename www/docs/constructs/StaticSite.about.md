The `StaticSite` construct is a higher-level CDK construct that makes it easy to create a static website. It provides a simple way to build and deploy the site to AWS:

- The assets are deployed to an S3 Bucket and served out from a CloudFront CDN for fast content delivery.
- It enables you to [configure custom domains](#custom-domains) for the website URL.
- It also enables you to [automatically set the environment variables](#environment-variables) for your static site directly from the outputs in your SST app.

## Working locally

To work on your static site locally with SST:

1. Start SST in your project root.

   ```bash
   npx sst dev
   ```

2. Then start your static site. With [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for example:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This should run `sst bind vite`.

:::note
When running `sst dev`, SST does not deploy your static site. It's meant to be run locally.
:::

## Custom domains

You can configure the website with a custom domain hosted either on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [externally](#configuring-externally-hosted-domain).

```js {5}
new StaticSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: "my-app.com",
});
```

Note that visitors to the `http://` URL will be redirected to the `https://` URL.

You can also configure an alias domain to point to the main domain. For example, to setup `www.my-app.com` redirecting to `my-app.com`:

```js {5}
new StaticSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    domainAlias: "www.my-app.com",
  },
});
```

## Environment variables

The `StaticSite` construct allows you to set the environment variables in your site based on outputs from other constructs in your SST app. So you don't have to hardcode the config from your backend. Let's look at how.

Imagine you have a Vite site and an API created using the [`Api`](../constructs/Api.md) construct. To fetch data from the API, you would pass the API's endpoint to your site.

```ts {7-9}
const api = new Api(stack, "Api", {
  // ...
});

new StaticSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "vite-app/",
  environment: {
    VITE_APP_API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```

Then you can access the API's URL in your frontend js code:

```ts
fetch(import.meta.env.VITE_APP_API_URL);
```

#### Type definitions

If a `vite.config.js` file is detected in the `path` folder, SST also creates a type definition file for the environment variables in `src/sst-env.d.ts`.

```ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly VITE_APP_API_URL: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```

This tells your editor the environment variables that are available and autocompletes them for you.

![Vite environment variables autocomplete](/img/screens/vite-environment-variables-autocomplete.png)

You can also override the path for the generated type definitions file.

```js {7}
new StaticSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "vite-app/",
  environment: {
    VITE_APP_API_URL: api.url,
  },
  vite: {
    types: "types/my-env.d.ts",
  },
});
```

#### While deploying

On `sst deploy`, the environment variables will first be replaced by placeholder values, ie. `{{ VITE_APP_API_URL }}`, when building the Vite site. And after the api has been created, the placeholders in the HTML and JS files will then be replaced with the actual values.

#### While developing

To use these values while developing, run `sst dev` to start the [Live Lambda Development](/live-lambda-development.md) environment.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

Then in your Vite app to reference these variables, add the [`sst bind`](../packages/sst.md#sst-bind) command.

```json title="package.json" {2}
"scripts": {
  "dev": "sst bind vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
},
```

Now you can start your Vite app as usual and it'll have the environment variables from your SST app.

```bash
npm run dev
```

There are a couple of things happening behind the scenes here:

1. The `sst dev` command generates a file with the values specified by `StaticSite`'s `environment` prop.
2. The `sst bind` CLI will traverse up the directories to look for the root of your SST app.
3. It'll then find the file that's generated in step 1.
4. It'll load these as environment variables before running the start command.

:::note
`sst bind` only works if the Next.js app is located inside the SST app or inside one of its subdirectories. For example:

```
/
  sst.json
  vite-app/
```

## Examples

The `StaticSite` construct is designed to make it easy to get started with, while allowing for a way to fully configure it as well. Let's look at how through a couple of examples.

### Creating a React site

Deploys a React site created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

```js
new StaticSite(stack, "react", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "dist",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  environment: {
    // Pass in the API endpoint to our app
    VITE_APP_API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```
Note that [Vite has a convention](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) to only pass the environment variables that begin with `VITE_`.

### Creating a Vue.js site

Deploys a Vue site created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

```js
new StaticSite(stack, "vue", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "dist",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  environment: {
    // Pass in the API endpoint to our app
    VITE_APP_API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```

### Creating a Svelte site

Deploys a Svelte site created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

```js
new StaticSite(stack, "svelte", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "dist",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  environment: {
    // Pass in the API endpoint to our app
    VITE_APP_API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```

new StaticSite(stack, "gatsby", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  errorPage: "404.html",
  buildOutput: "public",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
});
```

### Creating a Jekyll site

```js
new StaticSite(stack, "jekyll", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  errorPage: "404.html",
  buildOutput: "_site",
  buildCommand: "bundle exec jekyll build",
});
```

### Creating an Angular site

  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "dist",
  buildCommand: "ng build --output-path dist",
});
```

### Creating a CRA site

Deploys a React site created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev).

```js
new StaticSite(stack, "react", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "build",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  environment: {
    // Pass in the API endpoint to our app
    REACT_APP_API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```

### Creating a plain HTML site

Deploys a plain HTML website in the `path/to/site` directory.

```js
import { StaticSite } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
});
```

### Custom domains

You can configure the website with a custom domain hosted either on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [externally](#configuring-externally-hosted-domain).

#### Using the basic config (Route 53 domains)

```js {3}
new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: "domain.com",
});
```

#### Redirect www to non-www (Route 53 domains)

```js {3-6}
new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "domain.com",
    domainAlias: "www.domain.com",
  },
});
```

#### Configuring domains across stages (Route 53 domains)

```js {3-7}
new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    domainName:
      scope.stage === "prod" ? "domain.com" : `${scope.stage}.domain.com`,
    domainAlias: scope.stage === "prod" ? "www.domain.com" : undefined,
  },
});
```

#### Configuring alternate domain names (Route 53 domains)

You can specify additional domain names for the site url. Note that the certificate for these names will not be automatically generated, so the certificate option must be specified. Also, note that you need to manually create the Route 53 records for the alternate domain names.

```js
import * as acm from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";
import * as route53 from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";
import * as route53Targets from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53-targets";

// Look up hosted zone
const hostedZone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(stack, "HostedZone", {
  domainName: "domain.com",
});

// Create a certificate with alternate domain names
const certificate = new acm.DnsValidatedCertificate(stack, "Certificate", {
  domainName: "foo.domain.com",
  hostedZone,
  region: "us-east-1",
  subjectAlternativeNames: ["bar.domain.com"],
});

// Create site
const site = new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "foo.domain.com",
    alternateNames: ["bar.domain.com"],
    cdk: {
      hostedZone,
      certificate,
    },
  },
});

// Create A and AAAA records for the alternate domain names
const recordProps = {
  recordName: "bar.domain.com",
  zone: hostedZone,
  target: route53.RecordTarget.fromAlias(
    new route53Targets.CloudFrontTarget(site.cdk.distribution)
  ),
};
new route53.ARecord(stack, "AlternateARecord", recordProps);
new route53.AaaaRecord(stack, "AlternateAAAARecord", recordProps);
```

#### Importing an existing certificate (Route 53 domains)

```js {8}
import { Certificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "domain.com",
    cdk: {
      certificate: Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, "MyCert", certArn),
    },
  },
});
```

Note that, the certificate needs to be created in the `us-east-1`(N. Virginia) region as required by AWS CloudFront.

#### Specifying a hosted zone (Route 53 domains)

If you have multiple hosted zones for a given domain, you can choose the one you want to use to configure the domain.

```js {8-11}
import { HostedZone } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "domain.com",
    cdk: {
      hostedZone: HostedZone.fromHostedZoneAttributes(stack, "MyZone", {
        hostedZoneId,
        zoneName,
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Configuring externally hosted domain

```js {5-11}
import { Certificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  customDomain: {
    isExternalDomain: true,
    domainName: "domain.com",
    cdk: {
      certificate: Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, "MyCert", certArn),
    },
  },
});
```

Note that the certificate needs to be created in the `us-east-1`(N. Virginia) region as required by AWS CloudFront, and validated. After the `Distribution` has been created, create a CNAME DNS record for your domain name with the `Distribution's` URL as the value. Here are more details on [configuring SSL Certificate on externally hosted domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html).

Also, note that you can also migrate externally hosted domains to Route 53 by [following this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html).

### Caching

Configure the Cache-Control settings based on different file types.

```js {6-17}
new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "build",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  errorPage: "redirect_to_index_page",
  assets: {
    fileOptions: [
      {
        files: "**",
        cacheControl: "max-age=0,no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate",
      },
      {
        files: ["**/*.js", "**/*.css"],
        cacheControl: "max-age=31536000,public,immutable",
      },
    ],
  }
});
```

This configures the `.js` and `.css` files to be cached forever, while the `.html` and other files to not be cached by the browser.

Note that the file options later in the array will take precedence over those earlier in the array.

### Content type

The content type for files is automatically assigned based on their extensions by default. For files without an extension, the default content type is `binary/octet-stream`. However, you can override this default setting:

```js {17-22}
new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  buildOutput: "build",
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  errorPage: "redirect_to_index_page",
  assets: {
    fileOptions: [
      {
        files: "**/a-json-file-without-extension",
        cacheControl: "max-age=31536000,public,immutable",
        contentType: "application/json",
      },
    ],
  }
});
```

### Advanced examples

#### Configuring the S3 Bucket

Configure the internally created CDK `Bucket` instance.

```js {6-8}
import { RemovalPolicy } from "aws-cdk-lib";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  cdk: {
    bucket: {
      removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
    },
  },
});
```

#### Using an existing S3 Bucket

```js {5-7}
import * as s3 from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  cdk: {
    bucket: s3.Bucket.fromBucketName(stack, "Bucket", "my-bucket"),
  },
});
```

#### Configuring the CloudFront Distribution

Configure the internally created CDK `Distribution` instance.

```js
import { HttpVersion } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  cdk: {
    distribution: {
      httpVersion: HttpVersion.HTTP3,
    },
  },
});
```

#### Configuring the CloudFront default behavior

The default behavior of the CloudFront distribution uses the internally created S3 bucket as the origin. You can configure this behavior.

```js {9-14}
import {
  ViewerProtocolPolicy,
  AllowedMethods,
} from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  cdk: {
    distribution: {
      defaultBehavior: {
        viewerProtocolPolicy: ViewerProtocolPolicy.HTTPS_ONLY,
        allowedMethods: AllowedMethods.ALLOW_ALL,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Using Lambda@Edge

```js {4-9,14-23}
import { Code, Runtime } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
import { LambdaEdgeEventType, experimental } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

const edgeFunc = new experimental.EdgeFunction(stack, "MyFunction", {
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
  handler: "lambda.handler",
  code: Code.fromAsset("path/to/dir"),
  stackId: `${scope.logicalPrefixedName("edge-lambda")}`,
});

new StaticSite(stack, "frontend", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  cdk: {
    distribution: {
      defaultBehavior: {
        edgeLambdas: [
          {
            functionVersion: edgeFunc.currentVersion,
            eventType: LambdaEdgeEventType.VIEWER_RESPONSE,
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Note that, Lambda@Edge functions will be created in the `us-east-1` region, regardless of the region of your SST app. If the app is in `us-east-1`, the Lambda function is created directly in the stack. If the app is not in `us-east-1`, the Lambda function will be created in a new stack with the provided `stackId`. And the new stack will be deployed to `us-east-1`.

:::caution
On `sst remove`, the Lambda@Edge functions cannot be removed right away. CloudFront needs to remove the function replicas from the edge locations. This can take up to a few hours. If the stack fails to remove, simply wait for some time and retry.
