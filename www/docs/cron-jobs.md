SST can help you schedule Lambda functions to run at specified time intervals. To do this you can use the [`Cron`](constructs/Cron.md) construct.

:::tip Example

Follow this tutorial on creating a simple serverless cron job in SST.

[READ TUTORIAL](https://serverless-stack.com/examples/how-to-use-cron-jobs-in-your-serverless-app.html)

:::

There are two ways to specify the schedule in the construct.

## Rate expressions

You can specify a rate at which a function runs. For example, every 5 minutes.

```js {4}
import { Cron } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

new Cron(stack, "Cron", {
  schedule: "rate(5 minutes)",
  job: "src/lambda.main",
});
```

:::note

The fastest rate a cron job can be run is every minute.

:::

Here are some sample rate expressions:

- `rate(1 minute)`
- `rate(5 minutes)`
- `rate(1 hour)`
- `rate(12 hours)`
- `rate(1 day)`
- `rate(7 days)`

If the value is equal to 1, then the unit must be singular. If the value is greater than 1, the unit must be plural.

## Cron expressions

Alternatively, you can specify a cron expression to have a function run at specific times, ie. every day at 12:00pm.

```js {4}
import { Cron } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

new Cron(stack, "Cron", {
  schedule: "cron(0 12 * * ? *)",
  job: "src/lambda.main",
});
```

:::note

All cron expressions use the UTC+0 time zone.

Here are some example cron expressions:
