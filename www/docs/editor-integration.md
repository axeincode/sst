It features built-in support for setting breakpoints in your Lambda functions, autocomplete, inline docs, and type checking. We'll be focussing on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) here but you can do the same with other popular IDEs as well.

## Breakpoints

With [Live Lambda Development](live-lambda-development.md) you can set breakpoints in your Lambda functions and test them locally.

:::info
To setup breakpoint debugging in WebStorm or IntelliJ, follow these docs:

- [WebStorm](live-lambda-development.md#debugging-with-webstorm)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](live-lambda-development.md#debugging-with-intellij-idea)

:::

For [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) you'll find a **`launch.json`** file in the `.vscode` directory in your projects. It **hooks up** Live Lambda Dev with VS Code **automatically**.

You can then open the **Run and Debug** tab and click **Start Debugging** to set breakpoints.

## Type Checking

SST is a TypeScript-first framework. SST projects are configured so that VS Code will **automatically** pick up the config and **typecheck** your code as you write it. This helps you fix issue early.

## Autocomplete

As you are typing, VS Code will also autocomplete the property names in your SST code. You can also press `CTRL + SPACE` to bring up the autocomplete menu.

These are thanks to the great TypeScript and TSDoc support that SST has.

## Inline docs

You can also find examples docs for each property by hovering your mouse over it.
