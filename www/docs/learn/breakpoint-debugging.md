title: Breakpoint Debugging
---

We now have our entire app; frontend and backend running locally. Let's see what it's like to debug it.

---

## Set a breakpoint

Open `services/core/article.ts` and set a breakpoint in the `list` function.

The `list` domain function is called by our GraphQL API to get the list of all the articles that've been submitted. So it'll get run when we load our app homepage.

We currently have `sst start` running in our terminal. Let's switch over to debugging through VS Code.

---

## Run and debug

First, stop the `sst start` CLI.

Then select the **Run and Debug** tab in the top left menu in VS Code, and click **Start Debugging** at the top.

Go back to our frontend and refresh the homepage. You should see it hit our breakpoint.

Now you can browse the values of the variables in our code. You can also inspect the call stack leading up to the function call.

Breakpoints show you the real AWS Lambda function event.

## Continue execution

Once you are done debugging, hit **Continue** to resume the execution.

Now you have a good feel for SST's local development environment. Let's start working on our app!
