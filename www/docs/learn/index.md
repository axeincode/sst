In this section we are going to build a full-stack app with SST and learn about its key concepts.

We'll start by creating an app with our starter and set up our local development environment. The starter includes a database, a GraphQL API, and a React frontend.

The starter creates a very simple Reddit clone. You can submit links and it'll display all the links that've been submitted. We'll add a comments feature to our app.

To do this, we'll start by adding a new database table. Then we'll add an API to our GraphQL endpoint. Finally, we'll connect it to on our frontend. And deploy it to the world!

The entire tutorial should take less than an hour. We recommend going through it once, to get a feel for how SST works.

Let's get started.
